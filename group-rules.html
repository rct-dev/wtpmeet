  <h2>Group Rules</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>Principles for Dialogue</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Respect First:</strong> Always show respect for others, even when you strongly disagree.</li>
      <li><strong>No Personal Attacks:</strong> Challenge ideas, not individuals.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid Extreme Labels:</strong> No name-calling or extreme labels like "communist," "nazi," or "traitor."</li>
      <li><strong>Critique Upward:</strong> Public officials and institutions can and should be challenged — not fellow participants.</li>
      <li><strong>Assume Good Intentions:</strong> If something feels personal, ask for clarification before reacting.</li>
      <li><strong>Value Context:</strong> People and issues are rarely black and white. Listen for the full story.</li>
      <li><strong>Prefer Human Connection:</strong> Use video or voice when possible — it helps remind us that we are talking to real people, not just text on a screen.</li>
      <li><strong>Disagree Thoughtfully:</strong> It's okay to simply say, "I disagree" without attacking someone's character.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>Why These Rules Matter</h3>
    <p>
      Our goal is to create a space where real conversations can happen — where disagreement doesn't turn into division, and where all voices are treated with dignity. 
      By following these principles, we strengthen our community and honor the spirit of the Constitution that brings us together.
